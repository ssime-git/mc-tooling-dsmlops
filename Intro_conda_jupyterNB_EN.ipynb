    "## Création de kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a kernel?\n",
    "A kernel is simply a program that executes Python code in a specific environment. It does not need to be stored in a subfolder of the virtual environment but in a jupyter specific folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ipykernel package is a Python package that provides the IPython kernel for Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you install ipykernel, it creates a kernel that can be used by Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to execute code in the virtual environment. This allows you to use the packages installed in the virtual environment in your Jupyter notebooks. It is necessary to install ipykernel if you want to use Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab with a virtual environment created using conda prompt from miniconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you install `ipykernel` in an environment, it creates a kernel that can be used by Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to execute code in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab, a **kernel** is a computing engine that executes code in a notebook document. It supports multiple programming languages and allows you to interact with the notebook document using that language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between a kernel and an environment is as follows :\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **kernel** is an interface that allows tools like Jupyter to execute code in a specific programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An **environment** is an isolated space containing a defined set of packages, which can have its own associated kernel (for example, a Conda environment with Python 3.8 can have a Jupyter kernel associated with it that uses this Python 3.8).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an autonomous directory that contains a specific version of Python and all additional packages that you have installed. It allows you to create isolated environments with different versions of Python and different packages installed in each environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a new virtual environment using conda prompt from miniconda, it creates a new directory with its own Python executable and packages. You can then activate this environment to use this specific version of Python and these packages in your terminal or Anaconda prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to create a kernel?\n",
    "\n",
    "With the following command, you can create a kernel within an environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# create a kernel within an environment\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name env_name\n",
    "\n",
    "# création de kernel (without an environnement) Think about activate the environnement\n",

    "## Why create different kernels?\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating different kernels is useful for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: You can use different programming languages and Python versions in your Jupyter notebooks, depending on the kernel you choose. For example, you can have a Python 3.8 kernel for one notebook and a Python 3.9 kernel for another notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Isolation**: You can install packages specific to each kernel, without affecting the other kernels or the base environment. For example, you can have a kernel with scikit-learn 1.3.2 and another kernel with scikit-learn 1.2.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reproducibility**: You can share your Jupyter notebooks with other users, by indicating the kernel associated with each notebook. This way, they will be able to run the code in the same conditions as you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a virtual environment, each kernel is associated with a specific Python environment. When you create a new kernel, you can specify the Python environment you want to use for that kernel. By default, the kernel is created in the base environment of your Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run code in a Jupyter notebook, the kernel associated with that notebook is used to execute the code. If you have multiple kernels in the same virtual environment, you can choose the kernel to use for each notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "To manage the kernels in a virtual environment, you can use the `conda` command followed by the `install` option to install a new kernel, or the `remove` option to delete an existing kernel. You can also use the `jupyter kernelspec list` command to display a list of the kernels installed in your virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Simply said : a notebook is like the client application that interacts with the kernel responsible for executing the code in the notebook.**"

    "\n",
    "## Differences between pip and conda\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to use `pip` commands to list and install packages. `pip` and `conda` are both package managers for Python, but they have major differences in their design, functionality, and usage. Here is a comparative table to highlight some of these differences:\n",

    "| **Nature** | Package manager for Python. | Package manager and environment management system, mainly for Python but also for other languages. |\n",
    "| **Package sources** | PyPI (Python Package Index). | Conda channels, with `conda-forge` being a popular channel. |\n",
    "| **Package format** | Wheels (`*.whl`) or sdist. | Conda binaries (`*.tar.bz2`). |\n",
    "| **Dependencies** | Manages Python dependencies. | Manages dependencies at both the language and system level. For example, `conda` can install non-Python packages like `gcc` or system libraries. |\n",
    "| **Virtual environments** | Must be used with `virtualenv` or `venv` to manage virtual environments. | Integrates its own environment management system. |\n",
    "| **Platforms** | Works primarily on Python. | Works with Python and other languages and platforms. |\n",
    "| **Installation of non-Python packages** | Limited, as it is specific to Python. | Can install non-Python packages, such as command-line tools or libraries written in C, C++, etc. |\n",
    "| **Integration with systems** | Less integrated with systems like Anaconda or Miniconda. | Is the package manager and environment management system for Anaconda and Miniconda. |\n",

    "Here is the translation of the selected text in English:\n",

    "In summary:\n",
    "- `pip` is a package manager specifically for Python and is ideal for libraries and frameworks that are purely Python.\n",
    "- `conda` is a more general package and environment manager that handles not only Python packages, but also system-level dependencies, making it ideal for projects that have complex dependencies or require non-Python libraries.\n"
